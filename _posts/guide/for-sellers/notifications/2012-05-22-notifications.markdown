Listening to Notifications gives you the ability to have a real-time feed of the changes that occur on the different resources of the MercadoLibre API.

For example if you published an item and later it was paused, someone made you a question, purchase your item or even paid for it and requested a shipping; you will receive a Notification of a change on the resource.

Notifications are a very convenient way to stay up-to-date with everything that you care, in the most efficient way for you, without having to query our API on a constant basis. You only get notified of the resource that changed.

## How do I subscribe to the Notifications? {#how-to-subscribe}

In the Applications Page where you created your App, you can edit the details and specify which 'topics' you will listen to.
(see [Applications Page](http://applications.mercadolibre.com)).
_If you haven't created your App yet go to [Creating your app section](http://developers.mercadolibre.com/creating-your-own-application/)_

  - **Notifications callback URL** Configure the public URL of your domain where you want to receive notifications for the different topics. e.g.: “http://myshoes-app.com/callbacks”.

  - **Topics** Comma separated list of 'topics' you want to subscribe to.

###Available Topics: {#topics}
- **orders**  — To get notified of any change on one of your orders. e.g.: you received an order from a purchase, the buyer added shipping instructions or the buyer added a payment to an order.

- **items**   — To get notified of any changes on an item you have published. 
	e.g.: Due to of MercadoLibre's rules your item was set to 'under_review'.
	The seller changed any of an item's attribute (price, title, description) and all the application's subscribed to that seller's feed get notified of the change.
	The 60 days period of a listing finished.

- **questions**   — To receive a notification for every question made to you or answered.

> NOTE: All the applications subscribed to the question feed will receive notifications for every answer the seller sends.
