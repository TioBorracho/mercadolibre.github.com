## Overview {#overview}

The first step in selling is list an item on MercadoLibre. Sellers can list an item by MercadoLibre site or by an application using Listing API. Both working exactly in selling.

There are a number of considerations over an item as title, category, price, currency or description. You already know what items and attributes exists. If you don’t know we recommend that you read the [Listings Introduction tutorial](/listing-introduction).

Some properties of items affects the appeareance in various pages where items are viewed (the view item page, the search pages, the category browser page )  

Also there are mandatory attributes to list an item. 


<div class="contents">
  <h5>Table of Contents</h5>
  <dl>
    <dt><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="goToByScroll('list-example')">Listing example</a></dt>
    <dt><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="goToByScroll('best-practices')">Best Practices</a></dt>
    <dt><a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="goToByScroll('list-defining-attributes')">Defining attributes</a></dt>
  </dl>
</div>

## Checking site policies {#check-policies}

When you first register in MercadoLibre you are immediately able to buy items, but if you want to sell items depending on the country you are on some extra information may be needed. If you try to list an item via API without completing this information you will receive an error. To avoid this step and the annoyance of looking up what the error means We recommend to start a selling flow through the site up to the step where the extra information is required.

- **1. Login/Register:** Start by registering/logging-in

- **2. Start list flow:** Click on the sell button on the home page

## Listing example{#list-example}

We're ready to list our first item. You can use the code below to create your first item:

<pre class="terminal">
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d
'{
  "title":"Anteojos Ray Ban Wayfare",
  "category_id":"MLA5529",
  "price":10,
  "currency_id":"ARS",
  "available_quantity":1,
  "buying_mode":"buy_it_now",
  "listing_type_id":"bronze",
  "condition":"new",
  "description": "Item:, {{"<strong> Ray-Ban WAYFARER Gloss Black RB2140 901 </strong>" | xml_escape }} Model: RB2140. Size: 50mm. Name: WAYFARER. Color: Gloss Black. Includes Ray-Ban Carrying Case and Cleaning Cloth. New in Box",

    {"source":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Teashades.gif"}
  ]
}'
https://api.mercadolibre.com/items?access_token=$ACCESS_TOKEN  
</pre>

## Best Practices {#best-practices}

Please, don't use list operation to test item's definition. Instead, use [validate operation](/validate-item) item before use list operation.

## Defining attributes {#list-defining-attributes}

To create your first item you need a number of attributes that can be set, some are required and some optional. All define how the item is displayed, how buyers can purchase it and how it will be used in searching results.    

### Title {#listing-title-attribute}

Title is the main descriptor of an item. This label will be used in searching and it's an important component of your item's detail. This is a required attribute. For more details about this attribute in MercadoLibre you can see the [visual introduction](/listing-introduction) and the [item title section](/listing-introduction/#item-title).   

You can add a subtitle attribute, that is optional, and it is used in view item page or in search result list. Together these parameters are very important to describe your item. If you have doubts about how to describe your item, visit [MercadoLibre site help](http://www.mercadolibre.com/jm/ml.faqs.framework.main.FaqsController?pageId=FAQ&faqId=9564&categId=MEJVT&type=FAQ).
